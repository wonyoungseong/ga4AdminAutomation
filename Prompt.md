I need you to build a full-stack application. The specifications are in ~/Developer/orc/App/Spec

Please:
1. Create a frontend team (PM + Developer) 
2. Create a backend team (PM + Developer)
3. Have them build according to the specs
4. Check on both teams every 15 minutes
5. Ensure 30-minute commits

Start both teams on Phase 1 simultaneously.
